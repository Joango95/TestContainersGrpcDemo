# TestContainersGrpcDemo

This is a demo project on how to use WireMock + TestContainers + gRPC.
This technolgies are really good when implementing integration tests. WireMock lets us mock any service request/response process in multiple languages, so being able to 
combine it with TestContainers is pretty useful for integration tests.
A quick guide on it can be found [here](https://medium.com/@joango95/using-wiremock-testcontainers-grpc-to-mock-services-for-integration-tests-fce6a22717d1)
